# Building Recommendation System with Spark
Abstractâ€”There have been growing interests in the area of
recommeder systems using machine learning techniques. As
there are various explicit and implicit features that can be used
for estimating user preference, it requires scalable and accurate
algorithms along with a system with high availability and
scalability. Alternating least square matrix (ALS) algorithm
is an enhanced version of latent factor models using matrix
factorization with good scalability and predictive accuracy.
Apache Spark is an open-source distributed platform for
processing big data, achieving good speed and scalability suitable
for iterative machine learning algorithms. Amazon offers
cloud computing services with various functionality including
data storage and processing engines and is highly available
and scalable. In this study, we applied the ALS algorithm
using Apache Spark running on an Amazon Web Service
(AWS) Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) cluster for recommending
a product with good accuracy and enhanced scalability.
